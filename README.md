# BON VOYAGE<br>
 
 
<b>1.   Introduction:<br></b>
Bon voyage is our web application’s name. It is a kind of application where people can arrange their vacation and travel destinations with suitable prices and deals of their own. It is a commercial application.<br>
People from time to time need recreation from their mundane life. So they often want to go on vacations or holidays to relax. But sometimes it is difficult for them to arrange since a lot of travel agencies have different prices and offers. So it becomes a little challenging for them to find a deal that will not be expensive and they can find reviews in one place. This web application will help them find good deals on places, hotels, restaurants, tickets with their reviews in one place.
The purpose of this app is to help people get the vacation of their choice. They can also make profiles and write about their experiences in a blog. Based on their travel history they can also get different coupons and services on their wishlist of their next destinations.<br>
The challenges we may face in this project is to convert this idea into a real life program and keep it bug free. Maintaining the security or privacy of the users and keeping it accessible are also a big challenge. <br><br>
 

<b>2.	Non-Functional Requirements:<br></b>
<b>Security:<br></b>
In any project, securing the system or application is the main task. There is so much personal information about people who are involved in any web application. So, if the system is incapable of providing a proper security system then our application will not be reliable. The system should protect the privacy of the users. To fulfill the requirement of the users, they should have set some policy. Such as the system shall automatically log out all users after a period of inactivity. The system shall not leave any cookies on the user’s computer containing any of the user’s confidential information.<br><br>
 
<b>Availability:<br></b>
The system shall be accessible to anyone who has a smartphone, computer or any other smart devices with internet connection. The system shall provide universal language.<br><br>
 
<b>Usability:<br></b>
The system will be user friendly and less complicated like anyone can understand the steps of consulting. Thus making it less time consuming.<br><br>
 
<b>Reliability:<br></b>
The information about designers shall be authentic and reliable. And it will be thoroughly checked and verified.<br><br>
 
<b>Documentation:<br></b>
User’s information will be kept in a secure and organized manner. So that no information will get lost from the database.<br><br>
 
<b>Performance:<br></b>
The performance of the functions will be well optimized, making the program run smoothly. The performance shall depend upon hardware components of the client. The system should minimize mistakes and give clear error messages that instruct the user on how to address the situation appropriately.<br><br>
 
<b>Maintainability:<br></b>
How well the system will work depends on the maintainability of the system. By providing good and efficient service to the users can fulfill this important requirement. The maintenance depends on the flexibility of the system. And to maintain the flexibility developers should have used the proper software and hardware.<br><br>
